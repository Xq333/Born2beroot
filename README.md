# Born2BeRoot Project README

## Overview

The **Born2BeRoot** project is a fundamental milestone in my 42 school journey. This project focuses on setting up and securing a Linux server, equipping students with crucial skills in system administration and server security.

## What I Learned

While working on the **Born2BeRoot** project, I gained invaluable knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Linux Server Setup:** I learned how to set up a Linux server using distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS, gaining hands-on experience in server deployment.

2. **User and Privilege Management:** This project taught me the intricacies of user account management, permissions, and access control on a server, crucial for secure server operation.

3. **Firewall Configuration:** Security is a core focus, and I acquired skills in configuring and managing a firewall to control network traffic, safeguarding the server.

4. **SSH Access:** I set up Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote access, and I became proficient in managing SSH keys for authentication.

5. **Intrusion Detection:** I implemented basic intrusion detection mechanisms to monitor server activities and respond to potential security threats.

6. **Security Hardening:** I learned best practices for securing a server, such as keeping software up-to-date, disabling unnecessary services, and configuring secure password policies.
